This is the code for an apparatus to play a piano based on midi inputs. The whole system runs on a micro-controller running [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/).

This project was the main part of my MFA thesis project, Beep-Boopatronics, which you can take a look at [here](https://maxlupo.com/beep-boopatronics/).

[Here is a video](https://youtu.be/Uxc-VaRnjG4) of the device playing a John Cage composition, adapted for a chord organ

## Parts

 The MicroPython MIDI library used was this one [here](https://github.com/SpotlightKid/micropython-stm-lib/tree/master/midi) by [@SpotlightKid](https://github.com/SpotlightKid).

 The servos are controlled with [this bit of kit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/815) by Adafruit.

 The 3D printed parts can be found over at [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2654830).

 Yeah, so, it is probably not super easy to make your own version of this project, but I hope you can take what's needed, to that it will be useful as inspiration.
